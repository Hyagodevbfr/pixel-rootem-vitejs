## About the project
Website to convert pixel units to rem(root em)
## Challenge
Recreate my first personal project, in order to practice javascript for react and some important concepts. In it I practiced several concepts, componentization, modularization, folder architecture (ITCSS), CSS writing standards (RSCSS), creating files with viteJs, standardizing commits (gitmoji), generating all elements using only JavaScript.<br><br>
My biggest challenge was the standardization, separating objects, components, following the rules of each concept. Importing and exporting was also a little difficult, integrating each function that was separate challenged me a bit. 
All the challenges served to fix these concepts in my mind.
